# jQuery UI Bootstrap for Rails asset pipeline

See [jquery-ui-bootstrap](https://github.com/addyosmani/jquery-ui-bootstrap)

## Install

`gem 'jquery-ui-bootstrap-rails'`

## See in the `vendor/assets` folder.

Note: Currently some of the assets are not linked correctly. This gem needs to be updated when the "mother project" supports Bootstrap 2.1. 

At that time I will try to make sure all assets are linked correctly and work.
They say they plan to use LESS, and I will then convert the LESS to SCSS using a bash script. Then it will be easy to use with Compass :)

Cheers!

## Important

Just discovered this repo and gem: [jquery-ui-bootstrap-theme-rails](jquery-ui-bootstrap-theme-rails) Please use instead or help merge the various forks into a nice gem for Rails that works with Bootstrap 2.1 :)

## Contributing to jquery-ui-bootstrap-rails
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet.
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it.
* Fork the project.
* Start a feature/bugfix branch.
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution.
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
